* verify the outputs

* 3. Comment on the frequency of exits â€“ does the number of exits increase at a stable rate? Or are there 
more exits performed during certain VM operations? Approximately how many exits does a full VM 
boot entail?

       No, the number of exits do not increase in a stable rate. Some of the exits increase, while the others stay same. The increment depends on the exit type. Approximately 1037272 exits.
    
* 4. Of the exit types defined in the SDM, which are the most frequent? Least?
  * EXIT_REASON_EPT_VIOLATION(48),EXIT_REASON_MSR_READ(31) happens the most frequent.
  * EXIT_REASON_DR_ACCESS(29),EXIT_REASON_EPT_VIOLATION(48) are least frequently occuring.
